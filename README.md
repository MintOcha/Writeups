# Writeups
## What is this?
This is a markdown directory of explorations I documented into different systems, and overall written it as a practice for writing cybersec writeups. It might also include certain "demo files" or "files of interest" just for a bit of fun :3
## Can i use this?
Sure! Just give credit!! I don't mind yall changing a thing or two, adding your own and using it for your own project. Just, make sure to fork it so it can be documented
## Contributing
Just open a PR! Dont be shy
